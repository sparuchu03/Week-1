# Week-1
Week 1 Machine Learning assessment covering basic ML concepts (supervised learning, regression, classification) and data handling in Python using a crop recommendation dataset. Tasks include importing libraries, reading data with read_csv(), displaying the first 5 rows, and using info() for structure analysis.
#WEEK -2
Removed duplicate entries to ensure data quality.
Performed detailed Exploratory Data Analysis using histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and a correlation heatmap for better feature understanding.
Encoded crop labels into numeric format to facilitate model training.
